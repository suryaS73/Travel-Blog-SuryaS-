                Jaipur is the capital and the largest city of the Indian state of Rajasthan in Western 
                India. It evokes the royal family that once ruled the region and that, in 1727, 
                founded what is now called the Old City, or “Pink City” for its trademark building color. 
                At the center of its stately street grid (notable in India) stands the opulent, 
                colonnaded City Palace complex. With gardens, courtyards and museums, part of it is 
                still a royal residence.

                Making its name among the most beautiful places in the world, Udaipur is an ethereal 
                beauty. Known as the “City of Lakes” it is a frequently-visited tourist destination in the 
                North Indian State of Rajasthan.

                Nature is at its best in Kerala with beaches covered with palm trees presenting a breathtaking 
                setting all together. Beaches at Kovalam and Varkala are sure to tempt you to take a dip in 
                the cool and fresh water of the sea.
